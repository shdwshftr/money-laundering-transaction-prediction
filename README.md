# Money Laundering Transaction Prediction
## About
This repository contains the code for the preliminary round of a local competition 'DSC Olympiad 2023' held by BINUS University Data Science Club. The team consist of 3 members:
* Team Name: Gwenchana
* Team Members:
* Brandon Ritchie Yang
* Davin Edbert Santoso
* Steve Marcello Liem

## Goal
In the competition, participants are required to make a machine learning algorithm to categorize whether a transaction is in a 'money laundering' or 'legal' category with the given synthetic financial transaction dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used in the project is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealtman2019/ibm-transactions-for-anti-money-laundering-aml/data?select=HI-Large_Trans.csv) which are generated by the IBM.
The dataset used is based on a virtual world inhabited by individuals, companies, and banks. The dataset required from the committee to be use to make the machine learning algorithm are the 'Hi-Large_Trans.csv' and 'Li-Large_Trans.csv'.

## Process
The code is written in jupyter notebook in ipynb format. The process include:
* Data Reading & Sampling
* Data Understanding
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Feature Engineering
* Modelling
* Evaluation
